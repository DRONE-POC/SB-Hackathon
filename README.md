## What problem are you trying to solve?

Create a micro-insurance for mobile devices by day. An AI will be used to determine a broken screen, and pay outs.
##  Why do you think Blockchain/SmartContract may be the right approach?: 

The zero touch philosophy, where a process can start at a customer and end with the customer, is possible with blockchain in this scenario. It manages all the business logic, triggers automatic payouts, and can house all the data we need. As the insurance expands, more companies can be invited into the blockchain to participate.

## API/DATA/Gadget you are thinking about using:

Artificial Intelligence
